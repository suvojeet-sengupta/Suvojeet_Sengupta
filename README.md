## 🎨 Design Philosophy

"Logic-First, Syntax-Second."

The design adheres to a premium aesthetic using:
-   **Vibrant Gradients**: Used sparingly to guide attention (Primary: Indigo/Violet, Creative: Amber/Orange).
-   **Depth**: Achieved through layered glassmorphism and subtle shadows.
-   **Motion**: Meaningful animations that enhance the user journey without overwhelming it.
